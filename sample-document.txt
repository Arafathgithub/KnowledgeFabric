The Solar System is a gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The Sun, a star of spectral class G2, contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally.

Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets. The remainder are smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. Earth is a unique terrestrial planet because it has liquid water oceans.

The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. The two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane.

The Solar System is also home to two regions of smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, is similar to the terrestrial planets as it is composed mainly of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices. Pluto is a well-known dwarf planet located in the Kuiper belt.

The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes, launched by NASA, are two spacecraft that have explored the outer planets. Voyager 1 has left the Solar System and entered interstellar space, a region between stars.
